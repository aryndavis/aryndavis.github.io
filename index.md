### Hello! My name is Aryn Davis and I am a current senior at Columbia Univeristy studying Computer Science and Sociology.

I am passionate about teaching and creating software for social good by properly considering the unintended negative impact of each product I take part in. I currently am Head Teach Assistant for [Justice Through Code](https://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/justicethroughcode), a coding bootcamp for formerly incarcerated individuals in order to support them in obtaining stable careers in the tech industry. 

#### Some of the projects I am working on:

- [plantParent](https://github.com/aryndavis/plantParent) is a tool to help you keep track of relevant care instructions for various plants by using HuggingFace's Bert Question and Answering Pipelines. 

- [react-spotify-project](https://github.com/aryndavis/react-spotify-project) where I wanted to explore to Spotify Web APIs, started with some code for the react-spotify-player from Joe Karlsson, fixed that code, and now this repo is for taking that same player and adding some more features!
